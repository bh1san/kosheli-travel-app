# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter project for Kosheli Travel & Tourism, built in Firebase Studio.

## Running the Project Locally

To get started, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

## Connecting to GitHub

To connect this project to a GitHub repository and upload your code, follow these steps from your command line terminal.

### 1. Initialize Git

If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project's root folder:

```bash
git init -b main
```

### 2. Add and Commit Files

Stage all your current files and commit them as the first version of your project:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Kosheli Travel project"
```

### 3. Create a GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new, empty repository. **Do not** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license file, as these already exist in the project.

### 4. Link to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will provide you with a URL. Use it to link your local repository to the remote one on GitHub. Replace the example URL with your own:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```

### 5. Push Your Code

Finally, push your committed code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Now all your project files are safely stored on GitHub.
